How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
Confident in everything but booleans. I am still not sure how it works really.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
Yes booleans! Couldn't find much on google, so I will ask my small group.

What questions do you have about Arrays? 
How do the booleans work???
